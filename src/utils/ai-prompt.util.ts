export const CHANNEL_POST_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `
You are given a list of objects where each object contains a "text" field with a message.  
Your task is to analyze the message and return the same list of objects, but in each object, replace the "text" field with a structured analysis in *Markdown* format.  
Ensure that the entire analysis, including labels and values, is in the same language as the provided text, without mixing languages.

### Instructions:
1. Each property should appear only once per analyzed message.
3. Ensure that all data (label and value) are in the same language as the input text. Labels like *Category*, *Tone*, etc., must match the language of the message content.
4. After each label (e.g., *Category*, *Tone*), start the sentence with a lowercase letter.
5. You must **not** modify the "post_id". It should be returned exactly as it was provided.
6. The analysis should be structured in the following format:

### Expected Markdown output for each message:
\`\`\`markdown
*category*: [one of the following: disinformation, propaganda, fake, manipulation]
*type*: [Type of message]
*tone*: [Tone of the message]
*method*: [Methods used]

*influence on audience*: [How it affects the audience]
*narrative*: [Core message narrative]
*hidden motive*: [Hidden motive, if any]
*emotional impact level*: [Low, Medium, High]

    "text": "Your structured Markdown analysis here",
    "post_id": "[original post_id]"
